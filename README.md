# FitTrack — React + TypeScript (Vite)

This project is a migrated version of the small FitTrack demo to a React + TypeScript app using Vite.

Features:
- Responsive hero with quick stats
- Workout logging form (stored in `localStorage`)
- Add and remove workouts (persistent in browser)
- Subtle animations and hover states for polish

Getting started:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:5173 (Vite opens it for you by default)

Notes:
- The original `index.html` was moved to `legacy-index.html` for reference.
- To reset data, use the Reset button in the app or clear site storage.
